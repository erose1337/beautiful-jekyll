And now for something completely different - in this post, we will learn how improvise and create music on the fly. 

There will be effectively no music theory in this post - I eschew domain specific languages as they tend to serve those who already know what they are doing rather than those who wish to learn.

What? Aren't you just a crypto nerd?

I have been playing guitar for approximately ten years, and I [have](https://soundcloud.com/its_ella_rose/the-duel) [a](https://soundcloud.com/its_ella_rose/devils-metal) [good](https://soundcloud.com/its_ella_rose/vanquished) [number](https://soundcloud.com/its_ella_rose/love-of-life) [of](https://soundcloud.com/its_ella_rose/the-hawaiian-song) [original](https://soundcloud.com/its_ella_rose/rockin-solo) [compositions](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Nmptt4DaC4vq/) that are half improvised, half consistent composition. I'm arguably a lot more competent at music than I am at cryptography. If you click any of those links, I hope you can listen through the poor recording quality to appreciate the quality of the composition(s) - webcam quality audio is the best I have been able to provide so far, which I hope to be able to change some day. 

How to write music on the fly
----
We will not be composing music from a theoretical perspective on paper - you will require some kind of instrument to practice these techniques. Ideally, mastery of these techniques will allow you to create new music on the fly.

In general, all problems become easier when they are worked on one dimension at a time. There are many dimensions that are necessary to fully describe any given sound. The most basic and most familiar dimensions are:
- The rhythm, or how frequently the sound is made (plotted on the x-axis)
- The pitch, or how high or low the frequency of the sound itself is (plotted on the y-axis, traditionally as notes in half-step intervals)
- The volume, or how loud or soft the sound is

The pitch dimension
-----
To design a song, it is simplest to first establish a basis for one dimension at a time. I recommend starting with the pitch dimension.

- pick a set of 3 to 5 chords to create a palette for the type of song you want to play
    - Just play something, anything, and listen
        - Be sure to take note of what type of sound those notes provided
    - for example:
        - pick a set of happy sounding chords for a happy song
        - pick a set of sad sounding chords for a sad song
        - etc
    - if physically playing the chords is too challenging, try sticking to [power chords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_chord)
        
Once you have selected your chords, note the positions that they are located on the instrument that you are playing - so long as you refrain from playing notes other than the ones that you have selected, almost anything that you play will not clash or sound "off".       
        
Next, choose an ordering for the set of chords

- find a chord progression that sounds complete and resolves nicely, using *only* the chords/notes in the set that you selected
    - play some pattern using only the notes of the first chord
        - "some pattern", just play something, anything!
            - make sure it is simple enough to remember and play again
            - less can be more, try to make better music with fewer notes
    - play some pattern using the notes of the second chord
        - could be the same pattern played over the first chord, or a variation of it, or a completely new rhythmic pattern
    - play some pattern using the notes of the third chord
    - ...  
    - repeat until satisfied or you arrive at a natural resolution of the sounds
    
The rhythm dimension    
-----
You can also start from the rhythm dimension instead of the pitch dimension. Paul Gilbert has an excellent lesson to demonstrate this [here](https://hooktube.com/watch?v=f4c0Bt9KmFQ). 

In case you're disinclined to watch the short five minute video, allow me to recap:

- Forget about pitch/notes, and begin with only a scratch chord
    - "scratch chord" = strum the string(s) without allowing them to sound, to create a pitch-less chopping sound
- Using only a scratch chord, begin to play any kind of rhythmic pattern
    - pattern is the key word - it needs to have a structure that is consistent on some level
- After the rhythmic pattern has been established, slowly introduce real notes while maintaining the same rhythm
- Eventually, change out all of the scratches for real notes
    - Or leave some scratches present - they can provide more color to the sound
- Include more dimensions, such as vibrato and glissando (slides)
    
This lesson may not translate directly to non-stringed instruments - keys, horns, and other instruments may not offer the ability to play a scratch chord.

Other dimensions
-----
After you have established a rhythmic and tonal basis for your new piece, consider adding some of the following ingredients in to spice it up:

- legato 
    - hammer-ons and pull-offs
- glissando 
    - slides
- vibrato 
    - alternating up/down variation in pitch, i.e. bending the string on a guitar
- staccato 
    - cutting a note short
- tapping
    - tapping is a recipe for [instant rock-stardom](https://hooktube.com/watch?v=EX9XAPpmH8M&feature=youtu.be&t=7m9s)
- arpeggiation 
    - playing the notes of a chord in sequence, one at a time, as opposed to all at once
    
Finally
-----
With some practice, you will soon be able to create *new* compositions **on the fly** - you will have access to an unlimited amount of new music!
