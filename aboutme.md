My name is Ella Rose. I am a fast learner who's always keen to pick up new technologies and concepts. 

I am a top user on the [Cryptography Stack Exchange](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/users/29554/ella-rose) site with over 100 answers and over 100,000 visitors reached.

I have some skill in the following subjects:

- Computer programming/software devlopment 
  - 5 years of experience
  - I developed my own [application framework in python](https://github.com/erose1337/pride) that provides apis for audio, gui, networking, database, and security 
- Cryptography
  - 2.5 years experience
  - Extensive experience with [algorithm design and analysis](https://github.com/erose1337/crypto), including symmetric and asymmetric algorithms
- Cooking 
  - 10+ years experience
- Music 
  - 10+ years experience
  - I have [my own compositions](https://www.bitchute.com/video/Nmptt4DaC4vq/) of varying genres that I play on guitar
  
Additionally, I have many interests that I enjoy researching and reading about:

- Technology
- History
- Physics
- Psychology

As well as some subjects that I would love to develop skill with, instead of just reading about:

- Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Machine Learning
- FPGA/hardware development

I am [interested in freelancing, consultation, and full-time employment](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/3103584) for the right kind of work.

You can add me on [keybase](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/3103584) if you are so inclined.

A can of worms that I have yet to open...
